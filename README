Dependencies:

Run Software step by step:

Vite & Three.js
1. Alright, finally got this working for vite + threejs.
-failed to resolve import 'three'. does the file exist?
2. i thought vite could not load threejs at all from typescript/javascript.
  - actually, it was because i didn't include three's library. i guess for typescripti 'll have to use common.js


For Testing:
= trying to use node to run typescript
npm install -g ts-node typescript '@types/node'
